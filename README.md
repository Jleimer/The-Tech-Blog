# The-Tech-Blog
This website is for a tech blog.  When you are directed to the site you are presented with post.  At the top you have the option to login or signup.  Once you do either you can navigate to the dashboard and see your post.  You can create new ones or delete old.  You can also comment on other post and edit your post.  Any post that are made are then available for anyone to view.  I could not get the site to deploy to heroku even after help from TAs so I made a video below to demostrate the site.
